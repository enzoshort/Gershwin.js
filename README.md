# Gershwin.js
A simple web framework to make development easier. It uses simple, English like objects to remember basic data. The rest of the website is just a skeleton to base your site off of. 
The folder comes with optimized GershwinJs styles, and an optimized HTML file.

The commands Gershwin has so far are: 

Gershwin.alert (To test and make sure Gershwin is up and running.)
Gershwin.standardTitle (To make a standard displayable title in the top of the page.)
Gershwin.standardFooter (To add a standard footer to the site.)


GershwinJs is a simple way to make a site. Combined with it's css file and it's HTML file it creates a good starting point for a site. The reason these simple Gershwin commands were made was because I felt the need to store data seperately from the HTML, this way i can add or manipulate my existing site!

Enjoy! And help me make changes and add new features!
